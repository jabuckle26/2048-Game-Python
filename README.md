# 2048-Game-Python-
My development of the popular mobile app game 2048, built with Python to be playable on desktop (requires Python 3.7 installation). This project was intended to practice the use of functional Python programming and to try out the Pygame library.

The user must have Python 3 installed.

The Pygame and Numpy packages must also be installed via the command line (e.g. pip install pygame ) or through the users Python IDLE package manager.
